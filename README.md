# SoA-Make-Exp
R script to create the trials files for the SoA experiment.

This code is Yoni Stern's "make_SOAL_exp" repository with the addition of the temporal alteration compatibility.

The main code to run is make_main_trials_SOAL.R but all the other files contain important information that needs to be checked before running such as output directory, input csv, and working directory.

Each template csv creates a different part of the experiment: spatial, temporal, and combined.
